"There have been a total journey of over three days, I had visited China."

How many of our interests?

PM MODI: I am not conscious.

What is the situation where the people have changed?
"PM MODI: Pakistan are operating in different ways, which are operating."
This government has been associated with the elected a system of the new democracy.
"In our efforts, our efforts are continuously on the ground."
But our mutual cooperation is peace.
Our mutual interest is to maintain the interest of our country.
"We want to invite our conversation with pride and receiving me mention in a function as we have accepting the dialogue of our visit to Ssworn in our interests."
"And that is why, I said that the soldiers had a fitting answer to those of our country, and they are doing it."
"ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, what you ’ re the issue of strength to be“ Lakhs of lakhs. ” "
There are some issues which have been a matter of concern.
I would like to take this from the snake.
"In 2014, there were necessary to be held to have been a lot of courage between the two countries."
It was the only government that has been brought about with Pakistan.
One more thing was that is ‘ Laxman Repository of Malakti ’ and given us should take steps.
But there are no limit for that.
That is why India has always been in every times when the River Ganga.
There are no global prestige of that.
No world needs the world to think of India ’ s Bhutan.
The world is appreciated India ’ s Bhutan.
"And if we were not alone, when we talk about the fact that we do not know everyone was involved."
Now we need to be done by the world.
Our objective is to the world.
"Similarly, India ’ s needs in the world polar terrorism."
"Sometimes, when he used to say that this is your law and order, the time of your villages."
"Today, the world must be agreed on the basis of terrorism."
"India ’ s discussions with terrorism, Terrorism, India experienced human beings are capable of this all, and capabilities are now justiting."
So we believe that we will continue this process.
"ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, I will continue to be questionably."
You have launched many projects in the last two years.

"Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ’ s ideology will create our political, economic and social ideals."
"Mahatma Gandhi said,“ there is a remarkable building for the society. "
So I am very simple for development.
"It will benefit the poor, who have the most from development to the poor."
My focus is on the financial programme of my focus.
"But the poor must have to save the strength of the poor, how he has to be affected by Rajkot and poverty."
"I have been help to the poor, who save the poor will also be able to help them."
I have said that there is no wrong or wrong.
All these programmes have the poor to empower the poor and their lifestyle of their lifestyle.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is not just about the poor people.
"That is also a part of the economic system, they are also indeed by their economic system."
"Even by the bank, the bank ’ s banks are now being obtained."
"It brings about a transformation, of mental transformation."
"If you were noticed in the way, you can ensure that rupees forty thousand crore rupees are being involved in the banking system."
"In the cow of the TARYO, 90 or 40 homes are being celebrated in building toilets in the Batteries."
This change has come from a quality of life to a changing life.
I have launched the ‘ Swachhata Abhiyan. ’
We can change about how can we help the poor.
"Thus, you may have noticed that under the Start-up India, which is a Start-up India, Stand Up India activities, Port, Port, Make in India, and Sayint-up activities."
All these are directly beneficial for the middle class.
There are middle class and middle class for the middle class.
We should create jobs.
How can you create job?
"I do not know if investment in infrastructure development, no job creation has been generated."
"I had the example of the Istock India, to take every bank, every woman to the entire bank or an entire area of women, just a luxer or a young person or a young women."
This will create jobs.
This is my economic principles.
"You are no actually mentioned that you have the date to spend some days, but do not have the impact of the various immediate results."
The results can be seen in 3 or 5 years for the year.
There are now challenges as well.
You will talk about the job creation.
"When you have evolved to be the most vibrant Economic environment, you can be the biggest achievement in the Global economy."
You have spoken about it.
"There are three countries in our country, when people from the domain of milk, newspapers, newspapers, out-markets, etc."
We have given loans to private outlay on account of Rs. 1.25 lakh crore.
Now this people get money?
Their profession is to expand.
I extended to all the people have done their work.
We have taken another step to small decisions.
"A large number of seats or small businesses, have come up to these small businesses."
"So, if an eternal occasion was not in the beginning of a day then, I can do one day if one has to work for the person and that is working as if a person has to work for the family."
You must have seen that last year we watch water.
"The Jawans of this time there are people who benefit fit to create jobs, creating employment."
Those who have got more employment opportunities will be benefited.
It has been the first time that the tax revenue for the first time and employment has been taken.
"Keeping in view the employment opportunities, and creating employment for the common people."
"ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, there ’ s question in the food price of food, even as a question."
"There was a lot of food, that the food is expected to do."
PM MODI: You must not look at the subject of festivals.
"Hence, we should look at the reality of price."
It should be the only time to see the consumers.
"He said effort is not being made to taxes and those who are not being fulfilled with price, to be seen."
We should adopt the fact that we have to be accepted.
"The speed of the previous government, which does not happen at a rapid rate of growth but now it is not getting risen."
"Second, the country had two years of severe drought."
"Hence, the production of pulses is rising for pulses, then the soil from the bottom of the farmers is spending."
And when a big fruits of a person is not in one ’ s heart.
This is the second phase of the project.
The Government of India has import pulses in huge domestic crops.
It will be a joint responsibility of the Centre and the States.
"It is not the State Government, or the Union Government does not do that."
"Yet, it should be accepted to joint Industry."
That is why the Union Government has given a law to provide stringent legislatures.
The State Government must take decisions and decisions that the procurement can be taken by such storage.
Some states have done a lot of work.
Some states are striving to be made.
But the state and Central governments are being taken to this direction.
"But, we have also been successful in rapid growth of many millennia."
"As pulses, there are also low in India ’ s production."
"The farmers are now seen by soil, and the farmers are now growing at a farmers."
We have tried to make minimum support price for various pulses.
We have taken steps to go to farmers from Bose.
Our focus is on production of pulses.
"All efforts are doing so, the more efforts of the Government do not appreciate the honest of the government."
This is being discussed on it.
"Do not remember Raghuram Raghuram, be the best out of Raghuram?"
"You have seen that despite the whole country, they have come up."
The Prime Minister had completed the period of the previous government.
"Second, those who are associated with the Government in my two years, who are eligible for a diplomatic change."
ARNAB: Why do you get?
PM MODI: I am not so.
"Prime Minister Raghuram ji has no less than two and a country."
"I know that Raghuram Raghuram Rajan, he is home to any country, and he is a service to the nation."
He is a person who loves the country.
"In your address, you said that about seven medals from SS, had been a unique, integrated, sensitivity, transformative, sense of emotional, integrity and sensitivity."
He has been criticized by senior rulers who took a serious stake.
I say this is why we all are you?
"PM MODI: Be, whether someone is not the or for other people, or for different ways."
Such campaign will not benefit the country.
Everyone should be responsible for betterment and transform.
But one thing does not know that one is wrong than any kind of the system.
This issue have had been held on the political discussion.
You have taken steps.
"He said that since then, you have been able to fail the law has been at the right to a strict law, and the strict amount will be passed."
"Thirdly, you must have seen that under Mauritius, you are going to be on the path of Mauritius."
"Even if someone has not been doing something about the people of India, Modi will be at the people of India."
The entire country is full of confidence.
ARNAB: do you think about law for paying a laws?
A number of cases are mentioned in the reports being mentioned in the reports, and the reward is again. "
Some of the strength are some powerful.
"In the demise of the glory of the August, I do not refugee."
"And, we are deeply appreciated that all the persons associated with the Indian Ocean."
"ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, let ’ s address the US Congress in the US Congress, and the Lok Sabha."
The magnitude of the MoU was implemented.
"If one would not have the same, then it will be tomorrow."
There are a few issues going on the governance.
There was a great saint that are discussed.
We should dedicate it to the spirit of his life.
The spirit of this resource is the responsibility of every citizen to bring a spirit of democratic values of democracy.
"ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, has undergone a half years from the date of the Goods and Services Tax and the report for a half years."
"It means, it is not a loss of lives for the poor people."
"This is not getting the proof GST would not be permitted by the State of Bihar, Odisha and Assam, that is why the traditional people of Assam and patients of the country."
He will be first of the States that will be amongst the suggestions in the State.
They prevented them.
There was no one thing else that of this fact.
PM MODI:
PM MODI: We have held all levels.
And the Prime Minister said that people are not striving to recall this thing?
"During 2014, you must have seen that when I register the issue of development in the elections."
I hope that such a good atmosphere of around the country is necessary for building a better environment.
And the nation has to move forward in the context of development.
"I would like to tell media, let me mention you all as to do not make you the best possible."
ARNAB: We are not able to look after them.
"In order to see a old Voter, I have seen that a person does not find use so many things but she is doing discrimination."
"If you focus on that continuous and I want to focus on politics, and what I am not on politics, but the strength of the party."
The Cooperation Committee was discussed in this regard.
I understand that the Election Commission also has written this event and also written letters to me.
"As the fight against black money, this fight against black money has also been brought to the black money."
The country needs to be reforming the reforms of black money.
This is a reform of the election.
"If this initiative, that will be wrong."
ARNAB: Have you become a privilege to lead this consciousness?
"ARNAB: My colleagues for me, this is a very interesting resolution to the election of elections."
The State parties, which the State parties can be impressed by the proverb that this will have a strong impact. "
But a national party which is benefit to the BJP.
"And in 2014, there was no eight lacrore in the state."
"But, the BJP Rajya Sabha was held in Rajya Sabha."
"I am sure you are carry on a rapid pace, you will be in a very fast pace."
"You have said that if you have the strength to work in your office, you are it a difficult task!"
I believe that this is an endeavour that we can work to make everyone such a big nation.
"ARNAB: My last question, I proposed to mention some of the other subject about the last question, which I mentioned about a issue."
The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will get a relief to the cow and if you have come up in a soil from the 15th of days.
"This is the second half of the Arrival, the minimum relief, maximum relief."
"For the first time since Independence, I have brought about Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana."
100% of the total urea have come.
Earlier this was the even earlier Credit to select few.
The subsidy of the Government has been requested in the name of the farmers.
"ARNAB: But why do you believe that there will be a question of problems, I must not be any problem of the condition of the rains?"
"As I have met the leaders and I have done many states who worked together to the water issues, and the water problems."
