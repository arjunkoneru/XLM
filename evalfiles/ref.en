• Laying of foundation stone/Inauguration of:
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an interview with Times Now has shared his views on a range of issues.
ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview.
PM MODI: My greetings to all the people
ARNAB: I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects.
Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014.
The results came on May 16th.
"Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament."
I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor.
I was completely new in the job.
Delhi was new for me.
The Delhi environment was new to me.
And it’s not in words but in actual achievement.
"I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor."
We should not be talking about what we are aiming for.
For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright future
"ARNAB: Mr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy."
"The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest."
Your approach is pro active.
What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests.
"My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister?"
"I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics."
"Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments."
Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important.
There’s been a shift in paradigm.
Today we are building relations with countries across the world.
"The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect."
"The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect."
"When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it."
"But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership."
Every government has made an effort.
"It’s not that only this government is trying, it’s in continuity."
I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too.
PM MODI: The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen.
"Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue."
But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India’s interests in the most unambiguous manner.
We are a government that takes care of India’s interests.
We don’t compromise on this.
Three days ago I met the Chinese President.
I told him clearly about India’s interests.
PM MODI: See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets.
Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points.
Where do our interests converge and how much?
ARNAB: This statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress.
By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speech
ARNAB: There was a lot of humour.
You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique.
"But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear."
I am myself scared .
Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)
"ARNAB: But when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase."
Like hesitations of history.
How close can we get?
It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things.
"We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future."
We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people.
"Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack."
This is how you had phrased it.
Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?
PM MODI: There are two things.
We want to live in harmony and peace.
I said this before elections and during election campaigns.
Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well.
"So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour."
"Number two – those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength."
The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges.
It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country.
We are very proud of our Jawans
"ARNAB: When your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what’s happening and what’s not happening."
"If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses."
"There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December."
"On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris)."
"Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other."
This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit.
"After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok."
"And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore."
It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance.
"Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot."
"Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December?"
Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation?
PM MODI: Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan.
But the government only engages with a democratically elected system.
Our effort for that engagement is continuing.
But our supreme objective is peace.
Our supreme objective is to protect India’s interests.
"As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests."
And that is why I have said that my country’s soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing that
ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan.
There is some confusion surrounding this subject.
I would like you to give an elaborate reply.
"In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat."
It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan.
The other ‘Lakshman Rekha’ is that you must act on 26/11.
There’s been no forward movement so far.
That is why India will have to be on alert all the time.
India will have to be alert every moment.
Now I don’t have to explain to the world about India’s position.
The world is unanimously appreciating India’s position.
"If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle."
Now we don’t have to explain to the world.
The world knows our intentions.
"Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India’s theory on terrorism."
They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it’s your law and order problem.
Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism.
"India’s dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that."
So I believe we have to take this process forward
ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy.
In the past two years you have started many schemes.
PM MODI: The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line.
"Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay’s philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology."
And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man?
So my development parameter is very simple.
It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development.
The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda.
The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty.
By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways.
I am not saying right or wrong but it’s one of the ways.
All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor.
Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country’s economic system.
"The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank."
This brings about a psychological transformation.
"Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor."
That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets.
This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life.
I have begun the cleanliness campaign.
So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives?
"So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation."
These changes directly appeal to the middle class.
The middle class has its aspirations.
We have to create jobs?
How will job creation happen?
"Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation."
"For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs."
This will create many job opportunities.
So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.
"Many programs that you have mentioned, you can’t put a calendar date to it but they don’t have an immediate impact."
"They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years."
Now there are challenges in that.
Now you spoke of job creation.
"The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak."
You have spoken about it as well.
"More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors."
We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee.
Now why have these people taken the money?
To expand their work.
Three crore people have expanded their work.
We took another small decision.
If the malls don’t have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions.
"So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people."
You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy.
"Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment."
"The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get."
"For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked."
These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizen
"ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased."
The expectation was that the food inflation would decline.
PM MODI: You can’t view inflation as a perception issue.
Price rise should be seen as a reality.
What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is.
There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise.
We will have to accept reality.
"You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot."
"Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought."
"Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil."
"Now when there is such a big drought, it’s not in anybody’s hands."
The second option in such a situation is imports.
The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities.
It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments.
This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things.
But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both.
That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws.
How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take.
All these rights have been given to the states.
"Some states have performed well, some states are trying."
But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this.
We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices.
"But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low."
Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar.
We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses.
We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus.
Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses.
An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this government
A lot has been spoken about this.
Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan?
"You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure."
"For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term."
"Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram Rajan"
ARNAB: Why so?
PM MODI: I will tell you.
Those who say…I believe Raghuram Rajan’s patriotism is no less than any of ours.
"As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country."
He is someone who loves his country.
"During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter ‘S’– ‘Sevabhaav’ (service), ‘Santulan’ (balance), ‘Sanyam’ (restraint), ‘Samvaad’ (dialogue), ‘Samanvay’ (coordination), ‘Sakaratmak’ (positivity) and ‘Samvedna’ (sensitivity)."
Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats.
"My question is, do you think it is right?"
"PM MODI: Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate."
The nation won’t benefit from such publicity stunts.
One should be more responsible while conducting themselves.
Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.
There are political debates on this.
How will you address that expectation?
"From then on, you can’t imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is."
Thirdly you must’ve seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything.
"The people of India have confidence that if there’s someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it."
Citizens of the country have full faith.
"ARNAB: Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?"
The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront.
There are certain powers behind it.
The case about Agusta helicopters.
I can’t deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced.
"ARNAB: Prime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed."
Then the applause was more.
"If not today, it will happen tomorrow."
There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level.
"The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion."
Parliament is to show dissent.
"Parliament is to give an argument for one’s opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy."
"ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform."
Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar.
"Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam."
People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this.
They blocked it.
There was no argument on it
PM MODI: Made all efforts.
PM MODI: We held talks at every level
And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?
You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development.
This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.
And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development.
I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.
"PM MODI: Don’t make them heroes, they will stop"
"I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven’t even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TV"
"The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance."
This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee.
This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it.
"Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money."
Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money.
It is one of the areas for electoral reforms.
The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate this
ARNAB: Are you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?
ARNAB: I think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections.
"Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly."
That the national parties like the BJP will gain
Odisha is the best example.
"In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats."
I mean you keep a terrifying pace.
"The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep up"
I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible.
"ARNAB: Before I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers’ crisis."
"And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana."
"Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover."
"After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana."
We got urea 100% neem coated.
"Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers."
"After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming."
"ARNAB: Do you think that the farmers’ crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won’t be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?"
As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues.
"If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits."
ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.
"You’re also enjoying it and I am glad you’re speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir."
"You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it."
"I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn’t have heard any political comment from me."
PM MODI: It is a warning.
It is definitely a warning.
It is a warning.
I will use it at right places.
I won’t let it get stolen.
"PM MODI: See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied."
"ARNAB: Final question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most?"
This is my principle.
This is my inspiration.
ARNAB: Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege.
ARNAB: And thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly.
The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.
Happy Independence Day.

"We have a strong relationship with the University of Nairobi, where a Chair for Indian Studies has been established by ICCR, and renovation of its library is also being undertaken with Indian assistance."
Gentlemen present on the dais and brothers & sisters of Pune now gathered here in large numbers.
Quality works have to be done in villages with generation of job opportunities.
The quality of life has to be improved in villages.
Only then we will be able to check the exodus of population from villages to cities.
On the other hand piece meal thinking with targeted comeback in elections after five years will leave us as a loser on the front of overcoming the challenges mounting ahead of cities.
"We may have no political mileage for now, but after 25 or 30 years how our city will be visible and what will be the expected water requirement, required schools and hospitals, estimated traffic flow and its management will have to be a part of our vision."
Only then we will be able to meet the challenges of this fast pace urbanisation.
Rurban Mission is now that where villages are gradually becoming cities with spurt in population.
Such villages are within the 25 km periphery of big cities.
We have asked all states across the country to mark such villages.
And a detailed work is underway to develop such villages in the Rurban Plan.
This Rurban mission has a clear object of an urbanised village with a Rural soul.
The spirit of village should not die.
It should be secured and nurtured.
"However, village dwellers can not be forced to live in 18th century."
This is sufficient for now so make only a small road.
This leads to court cases and matter is kept in store for another 25-30 years.
This has been the practice.
"Laying of water pipelines will begin and by the time work is over, there will be so much population there that the pipeline will become insufficient."
Then there will arise the issue of laying big pipelines but how?
This indicates that we have not cared for future requirements and opted that kind of development model which gives only short term gains.
Now a solution should be evolved.
It is our endeavour now to develop more than 50 Metro cities in one go.
You can imagine the magnitude of burden we have decided to bear.
So it is our resolve to take projects in hand in such a manner that it should be complete in the given time frame.
"So if possible, effort should be to plan for things that are estimated to be required after 25-30 years."
"Today this approach may not be economically viable but ones the process takes off, we will also learn getting economically viable."
We want to bring chances in quality of life.
Today a Herculean task of connecting 2.5 lakh panchayats through Optical Fibre Network in the country is underway.
This Digital India is not a city specific work.
We can not push forward the nation unless we link the entire country with latest technique and science.
"There was a time when infrastructure was taken as road, rail or to a maximum airport was taken into thought."
This is past.
Now people want Highway with I-Way.
For I-Way we need Optical Fibre connectivity throughout the country.
Now with the time change they demand Gas pipeline too.
So we will have to update the visions and concepts of development.
And India must become advanced in this manner.
Government is working on this vision.
This is but natural.
This could have been done much earlier with a too lower expenditure.
People didn’t have suffered and not purchased vehicles in large number with a thought that when Metro is their why I should go for a vehicle.
There is no parking space too.
"Anyhow, better late than never."
"Friends, the earlier governments had reserved some very good assignments for me and I have an opportunity to meet your expectations."
I feel lucky in being with you now.
"How happy Mr. Jagtap ji is feeling now, I don’t know."
It is very difficult to express ones happiness if arising out of political factors.
This is not only in Pune but all over the country with the increase of 200 to 300 percent income for urban bodies.
Everybody though that better place it here else this will be swept away by Modi.
"This too is a good cause otherwise the tax collection by urban bodies had never gone above 50, 60 or 70 percent."
Law is violated by those who have higher approach.
But they are also now in the queue.
In a country everyone is equal.
Everyone must be abided by Law.
How the government have functioned so far?
I am not criticising anyone.
But it gives heart burns and pain.
What the country has been made?
You will be surprised.
"In 1988, Indian Parliament passed the Benami property Act after debate and discussions."
This became headline in newspapers.
But that paper got lost in files after coming out of parliament.
It got traced only when I came.
That Act was not notified then.
Law didn’t came into force.
"Had it been enforced by those who were in power in 1988, there might have been no sin in the name of Benami."
The nation would have been safe.
Such sin has been committed by those.
You ask me should I allow this to go further.
Please speak loudly for a solution.
Must we not do this rightly and must we not stop the destructive acts.
"So my brothers and sisters, had a timely cure for this illness was done, I wouldn’t was forced to take such hard step."
Such timely steps would not have forced my 125 crore fellow countrymen to stand in queues.
I am also pained by this.
But this decision is for country.
Inaction made country a big loser.
I had promised you to save this nation so is my action.
Brothers and sisters I have special expectations from Pune.
This is a city of our country with industrial heritage.
IT profession has deep roots in Pune.
Can Pune march further towards online payment?
"Can our mobile gets converted as mobile phone bank, yes or no?"
This bank could be in our hands.
Is it required to stand outside ATM?
Whether every facility is available or not?
"Will Pune people help me, yes or no?"
I am sure of your help.
"Only Aadhaar number, account number and your thumb impression are enough for payment now."
This will go further.
"Shri Sharad Rao, Kissan Leader are here with us."
"So is with the currency notes, more notes less value and finally no value."
Before 8th November there was no taker for 100 rupee note.
Even a child at home preferred either for Rs.1000 or Rs. 500 note instead of Rs. 100 as then that was taken as having no worth.
After 8th November it is now Rs. 100 everywhere glittering.
Small currency has now more value.
So friends after 8th November India is seeing enhanced strengthening of both bigger as well as smaller ones.
But you might have seen earlier instances.
Some people thought that all governments are alike.
Same as in the past.
Later we are all the way.
Have done this for years and will do it again.
Taking this as granted they went for bank deposits in the hope of getting it converted to white and valid.
Though the not didn’t got white rather their faces got blackened.
With state of the art technology everyone can be traced right from his home to everywhere.
"After one, two or three months everyone will be asked and approached for their transactions."
First you didn’t have now what is the source of your high income.
Those who took it as depositing their money in bank will make it white and valid should now be cautious.
Still you have a chance for a free ride.
Hence forth their no escape route.
So from this Pune soil I want to appeal everyone that be a law respecting and following person.
There are still certain rules that can be of your help.
"Come on the right track and have a peaceful tension less nap, There will be nothing to worry."
If you don’t return then I am not going to rest.
And this mood of 125 crore countrymen I am sure that gone are the days when these handful peoples were able to do their likes putting country at stake.
Now it is the turn of 125 crore people to have their say.
And a select bank of people will find it difficult to supress their voice.
"In the start of this process I had referred of 50 day problem, increased problem."
But after 50 days woes of honest persons will start receding and trouble time for corrupt ones will start uprising.
You will see this and this has begun.
Big shots are getting arrested and being sent to custody.
Many bank employees have been rested to their homes.
Some were dismissed and some have been imprisoned.
Metro work should start at fast pace.
"When Maharashtra elections were going on, I had said that for 15 years this vehicle of Maharashtra is stuck in a ditch, bailing it out of that will need double engine."
One from Delhi and other one from Maharashtra Government.
You have trusted us.
This is the power of double engine.
